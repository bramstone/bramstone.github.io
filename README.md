## Mapping, Visualization, and Data Exploration: US Coal Production
[Repository](https://github.com/bramstone/US-Coal-Production), [Project Narrative](https://github.com/bramstone/US-Coal-Production/blob/master/project_narrative.md)
This project utilizes the `ggplot`, `maps`, and the `chloroplethr` R packages.

Visualization and mapping of trends in coal mining in the United States from 2000 to 2016. Raw data were obtained in `txt` files from the **Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)**, which is under the US Department of Labor. This project demonstrates trends in coal over several decades, identifying patterns in production and employment. These data are intended to be integrated into a larger EPA dataset linking environmental and economic variables together, and are used in another project to build a predictive model frequency of mining-related accidents.
